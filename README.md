## Description

_Pierre's Bakery is a console app built to practice C# basics. The app takes a user's order for bread and pastries. The program accepts two user inputted integer values, one for the amount of bread they would like to order, and another for the amount of pastries they would like to order, and calculates and returns the total price of the user's order. The program also accounts for any discounts offered by the bakery (buy one, get one etc.)_
